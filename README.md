Git branch hierarchy:

main  
// only for showing the final progress

└── dev  
    // synchronize everyone's work

    ├── feature-backend  
    // for xuehua to write front/back-end code

    └── feature-css  
    // for shiran to change css

---

Workflow:

1. Change code on your local computer.  
2. Push to your own feature branch to save different version changes.  
3. Merge (Pull Request) to the dev branch so others can get your work.  
4. After confirming everything is correct, merge dev into main.
